# About me

## Hi!
My name is MrCelsius88. I am a passionate programmer and gamedev looking to get more acquainted with the blogging and youtube side of programming. I try to follow the *[handmade manifesto](https://handmade.network/manifesto)* in my projects and I am actively learning C from the community there along with resources like *[Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/)* and more. 

## Where my linux users at?
Over the summer of 2022 I found linux and was immediately sucked in. Sure it ain't perfect, but I still love it nonetheless :). (**I use Arch, BTW**)

I Will continue to update this website with more blog posts and content as time goes on. Happy coding!
